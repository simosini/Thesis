\section{Choose the right model}
Building deep learning applications in the real world is a never-ending process of selecting and refining the right elements of a specific solution. Among those elements, the selection of the correct model and the right structure of the training dataset are, arguably, the two most important decisions that data scientists need to make when architecting deep learning solutions. How to decide what deep learning model to use for a specific problem? How do we know whether we are using the correct training dataset or we should gather more data? Those questions are the common denominator across all stages of the lifecycle of a deep learning application. Even though there is no magic answer to those questions, there are several ideas that could guide your decision making process
